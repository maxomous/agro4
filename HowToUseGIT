For All Below, move to correct directory:
	cd /home/pi/projects/agro4


Initial clone:
	git clone https://github.com/maxomous/agro4.git


When logging on we want to download the latest master branch. To do this, select the master branch

	git checkout master

Then update with the latest src code

	git pull

Now we have the latest src code, we can create a new branch for our changes

	git checkout -b newbranch

Then we make some changes to the src code, and add these to the branch

	git add -A

We then need to commit them

	git commit -m "message"

And finally push them to the master branch

	git push 

*NOTE - if creating a branch which is further ahead than the master branch, you will need to write...

	git push --set-upstream origin newbranch

Then switch back to the master branch

	git checkout master

and merge the 2 branches together

	git merge newbranch

you will then need to push the new master branch again to update

	git push
